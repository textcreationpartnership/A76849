         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>REader, thou haſt here an exact account and Hiſtory of the Opinions, Blaſphemies, and practiſes of the <hi>Old Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> which ſo much infeſted thoſe States; and the <hi>New Quakers</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which have (of late) ſo much moleſted us: I have taken the pains of the Collection, that we being fore-warned of them, may be fore-armed againſt them, to avoid the like danger: they are a generation moſt peſtiferous in their Doctrine, and dangerous in their Seduction, and ſo ought of all men to be avoided. There are many of late, and ſome of noble rank and quality, that are ſenſible of their erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways, and are reduced from them; it is hoped (in a little time) many more will be ſo wiſe to do the like, which may prove the Death and Burial of their fanatick doctrine.</p>
            <p>I have made a faithful Collection both out of their own books, and out of Authors of known reputation, and (that I may the better cleer my integrity therein, I have all the way along) noted the Book, and the Page where every particular is mentioned.

               <p>IN the year 1521 <hi>Luther</hi> being proſcribed by <hi>Charls</hi> the 5. Emperor, was ſecretly conveyed away out of <hi>Wittemberg,</hi> by <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxonie.</hi> In his abſence <hi>Andreas Caroloſtadius</hi> one of the Miniſters of <hi>Wittemberg,</hi> began to preach ſome new doctrines of his own, and being a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate man, ſtirred the people to pull down<note n="(a)" place="margin">Some with us would pull down Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s and all.</note> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages out of Churches in a tumultuous manner. <hi>Luther</hi> for that chief reaſon being called to <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi> again by his friends, condemned the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Caroloſtadius,</hi> ſaying, That although himſelf hated Images, and wiſht them aboliſhed, yet it ought to have been done orderly, removing them firſt out of the minds of the people, and teaching them that by Faith only we pleaſe God, and that Images are of no uſe in Religion: That the Conſciences being thus informed and ſetled, Images would fall down of themſelves: Alſo that when Images ſhould be removed, he would have it done by the Magiſtrate, not by a popular ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, holding it a matter of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ſet the people on work about any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique action, which ſhould be done by the hand of Authority.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time a new Sect was ſpringing in <hi>Saxony,</hi> of ſome fanatical people, boaſting that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170433:9"/> they talked with God, and<note n="(b)" place="margin">En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts.</note> God with them, who commanded them to kill all the wicked and make a new World, wherein the innocent and godly ſhould live and reign alone; of which opinion <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> was either the author or the abettor: And when he could not get that doctrine received at <hi>Wittem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> where <hi>Luther</hi> was too ſtrong for him, he leſt <hi>Wittemberg,</hi> and reſorted to theſe new brethren.</p>
               <p>It is hard to ſay whether <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> or one <hi>Nicholas Stock,</hi> was the firſt founder of <hi>Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm. Melancthon</hi> ſaith that <hi>Nicholas Stock</hi> was he that began. He would ſay that God ſpake to him by an<note n="(c)" place="margin">So Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</note> Angel, and revealed him his will in dreams, promiſing him the place of the Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel,</hi> and the Empire of the World. He taught that the Saints muſt reign in the World, and that he muſt be their leader, to kill all the Kings and Princes of the World, and repurge the Church: He took upon him to have the gift of diſcerning the Spirits, and know the Elect; he made holineſs to conſiſt in ſpeaking little, and living homely and<note n="(d)" place="margin">Our Quakers ſordid enough, but great talkers.</note> ſordidly.</p>
               <p>In that mans ſchool was <hi>Thomas Muncer</hi> bred, who amplified much his Maſters doctrine. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach at <hi>Alſet</hi> a City in the borders of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> belonging to the Elector of <hi>Saxony;</hi> teaching that the burden of the Pope was too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and that of <hi>Luther</hi> too light; that his conſorts muſt have a new Baptiſm; Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t Chriſtians muſt be of an auſtere countenance, ſpeak little and wear long beards; This he calls the croſs and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the fleſh: Alſo that they ought to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170433:10"/> retire into deſarts or private places, there to think of God, and ask him ſigns, whether he think of them, and whether they be in the right Religion: He aſcribed much unto dreams, ſaying that God declareth his will that way, and praiſed openly in his Sermons ſuch as had dreamed a dream that bore ſome explication.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1525.</note>In that City of <hi>Alſtet</hi> he began firſt to make a confederacie, adminiſtring an Oath and taking the names of all them that promiſed to aſſiſt him in his deſign of killing all the ungodly Princes and Magiſtrates, and erecting new ones in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So long as he was content to preach of dreams and the like matters of leſs conſequence, <hi>Frederick</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> bore with him; but when he began to preach ſedition, he baniſhed him out of his dominions: And he having lyen hid ſome months, came to <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> and being driven thence alſo, came to <hi>Mulhus,</hi> a town of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> where many of his old Diſciples when he was at <hi>Alſtet,</hi> reſorted to him again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> hearing of this, writes to the Magiſtrates and Senate of the Town, that they ſhould not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>Muncer,</hi> as they loved their own ſafety, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing withall the mans doctrine and conditions, and exhorting them to ask <hi>Muncer</hi> who had given him authority to preach, and if he could ſhew no<note n="(e)" place="margin">To preach without an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is with ſuch the ordinary way.</note> ordinary calling, that then they ſhould eject him.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170433:10"/> they put down the Magiſtrates and ſet others in their place of their own faction. Not long after they drave the Fryars away, and ſeized on their houſes, of which the beſt was given to <hi>Muncer,</hi> who bore himſelf no more as a meer Preacher, but as a Senator; for he judged of all things out of the Bible and<note n="(f)" place="margin">Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptum, &amp; non ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptum, <hi>Thus far Papiſts.</hi>

                  <hi>Muncer</hi> was found hid at <hi>Frankhus,</hi> and lying on a bed faigning himſelf to be one of the Town that had been long ſick of an ague, which his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for fear did imitate to the life; but letters being found about him from <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him from his ſeditious couſes, he was known to be <hi>Muncer,</hi> which yet this lying Prophet denied long.</p>

               <p>Shortly after <hi>Phifer</hi> and other heads of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion were executed at <hi>Mulhus,</hi> and <hi>Muncer</hi> a while after, who ſhewed a great deal of dejection and perturbation in his end, and could not ſo much

               <p>In the mean while <hi>Luther,</hi> becauſe he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed by the Papiſts, as the author or occaſion of thoſe troubles, was ſending godly exhortations over all <hi>Germany,</hi> to exhort the commons to peace and obedience to their Superiours, and rather to ſuffer for righteouſneſs, then defend the Truth with unrighteouſneſs; and that this was the Devils cunning to raiſe ſedition by falſe brethren, to bring the Truth of God into hatred and obloquie.</p>

               <p>That <hi>Suevian</hi> Rebellion was ſoon after ſuppreſt, partly by the vigorous oppoſition of the Princes, partly by their own wearineſs and diſorder, the limbs of that faction dropping off here and there, like a rotten carkaſe that can no longer hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.<note n="(q)" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Melchior Hopman</hi> being kept priſoner at <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and his Sect ſeverly repreſt by the wiſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; that crew diſperſed it ſelf in <hi>Weſtphalia, Friſe, Holland,</hi> and moſt part of the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> where they got a very great party, yet among the common ſort of people onely. <hi>Lambertus Herten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> one of my Authors affirmeth confidently, that among that numerous rabble of ſeditious people, not one was found that ever was a Schollar, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170433:15"/> very few that could read or write. When they were confuted by reaſons or teſtimonies of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, their anſwer was, that the Spirit taught them otherwiſe, and that the Spirit bloweth where he liſteth, and doth not inſpire every one.</p>
               <p>Theſe fancies were increaſed by one <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> with many groſs and monſtrous Additions: The ſect by his ſeduction in ſhort time grew ſo ſtrong, as to deſpiſe all Rule, all Judges, and all Courts, and chuſe private Rulers among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who determined of all cauſes, and ſate upon life and death.</p>
               <p>But their rage could not keep long at home; They would ſometimes ruſh out of Cities in great troops, and ranſack Convents and Rich mens houſes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for their warrant the example of the Iſraelites, that took the ſpoyl of the Egyptians: Yet in theſe incurſions they made Conſcience at the firſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any Temple of thoſe that were not re-baptized, but made no conſcience to lye with their wives as left for a prey to the godly.</p>
               <p>This was their preparation for the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about which they had many revelations: One of their Prophets proclaimed that within three days the laſt judgment ſhould come<note n="(c)" place="margin">dooms<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day <hi>Sedgw.</hi>
                  </note>; This made many of them to leave their houſes, and get up into high trees there to expect the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt; but having expected three days faſting, they returned faint and weak, and met with another Judgment at home; for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate inquired after the Authors and promoters of that deluſion, and puniſhed them.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170433:15"/>
               <p>Of all Cities of the <hi>Low-Countries, Amſterdam</hi> was moſt peſtered with that ſect, the great concourſe and traffick giving them fair opportunity to reſort to that famous place: Where being many times repreſt with fines and impriſonments and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſeverity, they would diſperſe themſelves over the Country, filling all with clamour, ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing papers in the high ways, threatning ruine and deſtruction to all that would not adhere to them, and leave lands and houſes to come out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for <hi>Babylon</hi> they would overthrow; and within the circuit of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they included all Magiſtracy and Civil Government, and all wealth and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; A great quarrel they had with the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the whole World was little enough for their ambition.

               </p>
               <p>It grieveth me to ſay that in <hi>Munſter,</hi> truth made way for error: For in the year 1532, one <hi>Bernard Rotman</hi> came to S. <hi>Maurice</hi> Church hard by <hi>Munſter,</hi> where he preached good doctrine and converted many, ſo that the people would have him admitted into the City; Which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts fearing, gave him a ſumme of Money, upon condition he ſhould go to ſome other place, which he did, and abſented himſelf for ſome months, in which time he improved his gifts and learning, and returned again better furniſht to encounter the adverſary.</p>

               <p>Being received at Saint <hi>Maurice</hi> with greater applauſe than before, ſome Citizens of the beſt ſort brought him into the City, and becauſe the Church doors were ſhut againſt him they made him a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit in the Church-yard, and ſhortly after told the Papiſts, that if they would not open the door of ſome Church, they would open it themſelves. <hi>Rotman</hi> ſeeing the progreſs of the Reformation, ſends to <hi>Haſſe</hi> for ſome help, and they ſent to him two Divines of <hi>Marpurg;</hi> With theſe by the counſel and authority of the beſt in the Town, he challenged Papiſts in diſpute, and preſented thirty Articles of Papiſtical errours to the Senate, offering to prove that they were contrary to holy Scripture: The Senate ſends for the Clergy of the City, and requireth them that ſince they had always profeſt that their doctrine was grounded upon holy Writ, they would now make it good: The Clergy find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves unexpectedly put to it, anſwered plainly that it was more than they could, and that they were ſure they had a good intention, though there might be ignorance and errour in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion<note n="(d)" place="margin">Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia mater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votionis.</note>: Whereupon the Senate interdicted them to teach the People any more, and gave their places to the new teachers that had detected the impoſtures of the old.</p>
               <p>The expulſed Clergy retire to their Biſhop and Prince, (for the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> is Prince of the City.)

               <p>The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſeeing themſelves ſtrong, ran to Saint <hi>Maurice</hi> Church and burnt it with all the houſes about it, pillaged all the Churches, defaced the Cathedral, depopulated the Convents and Colledges, and burnt a fair great Library belonging to the Fryers; And for the final exploit, drove all the <hi>Evangeliques</hi> out of the City, but ſome few (whom they miſtook for <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>) crying, Get hence all ye wicked, elſe you ſhall all be ſlain.

               <p>And now the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> being Maſters of the City, began to order their new State; for though they were enemies to all Superiority and Order, yet neceſſity and Nature it ſelf forced them to elect ſome Superiours of their own. They made two Conſuls, <hi>Knipperdolling</hi> and <hi>Kippenbrok,</hi> and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Senators or Aldermen, that had the Civil power.

               <p>The moſt famous of theſe Prophets was <hi>John Matthias,</hi> a Baker of <hi>Harlem,</hi> who was in effect a perpetual Dictator in <hi>Munſter,</hi> that made Laws and changed them after his pleaſure: By him was the foreſaid Order made; His chief adjunct was <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and the next <hi>Bern.

               <p>With that common Stock they kept four great Ordinaries in the four quarters of the Town, where all fed in common, none being allowed to diet at home, unleſs he were ſick: Plenty of proviſion they had, and they husbanded it very ill, feaſting every day till the Biſhop that beſieged them, began to cut off their victuals, and then they ſtinted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but with too large a ſtint, which was to have change of meat every third day, one day freſh meat, the other day hung meat and bacon, and the third day milk, butter and cheeſe.</p>

               <p>To make amends for his falſe propheſie, He runs in a mad mood over all the City, bearing a Pike, crying, that God the Father had commanded him to drive the enemy back from the City, and ſo ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alone into the enemies camp, without fear and wit,<note n="(p)" place="margin">Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way mad.</note> and was there killed.</p>

               <p>But he fell to other work before he ſtirred that point; <hi>Knipperdolling</hi> came out w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> a revelation, that they that were in high places ſhould be brought down to the loweſt; &amp; they that were in the loweſt, raiſed to the higheſt<note n="(r)" place="margin">They will turn all upſide down.</note>.

               <p>But there was need of more revelations for that great work of alteration of the government; <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> was led by his prophetical ſpirit upon the City walls, where he put off his clothes, and ran<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">The old trade</note> naked through the City, crying, <hi>The King of Sion is come, The King of Sion is come.</hi> Then returning home, he falls into a deep prophetical ſleep, and<note n="(t)" place="margin">Filthy dreamers Jude 8. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This ſeemeth to have been his firſt motive to broach that doctrine; A Souldier of the Biſhops that had changed party, and was harboured where <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> lay, obſerved in the night, that this holy Prophet left his bed, and went to the maids bed<note n="(y)" place="margin">Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the fleſh. <hi>Jude</hi> 8. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This oracle was followed with great ſhoutings and acclamations of the people, crying, <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> and preſently he was brought to S. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> Church-yard, and there again proclaimed K.</p>
               <p>There the new King created four Counſellors of State, the chief whereof was one <hi>Gerard</hi> a Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binder, one <hi>Talbeck</hi> he made Lord Steward of his houſhold, <hi>Gerard Kippenbrok</hi> Treaſurer of his Plate and Jewels, <hi>Knipperdolling</hi> Governor of the City, and appointed twelve Archers of his Guard.</p>
               <p>This Taylor King preſently made uſe of his skill to make himſelf fine in clothes. He tranſlated the copes and carpets of the Churches &amp; convents, into dublets and breeches, and cloaks, which ſet off his Majeſty all in gold and ſilver. His horſes wore a ſuitable livery, richly harneſſed with golden and ſilver Saddles and footcloths; he had great change of rich apparel, in which he appeared abroad, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his chief Officers aid Counſellors riding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in great State. Next to him rid two young men richly attired, the one carrying a naked ſword with a golden hilt, ſet with precious ſtones, the other carried a Bible and a <hi>triple Crown</hi> of gold, of exquiſite work, glittering with diamonds. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wore a great <hi>chain of gold about his neck,</hi> like a Coller of ſome noble Order, with a golden Globe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170433:23"/> having a golden Sword thorough it, hanging at the chain, with this Motto about the Globe, <hi>Rex juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae hujus mundi,</hi> the King of Righteouſneſs of this world. After him followed fifty Penſioners clad with parti-coloured garments of aſh-colour and graſs-green, white caps, and golden rings on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very finger, making the aſh-colour an emblem of mortification, the graſs-green of regeneration, the white caps of innocencie, the golden rings of charity: but among theſe prophetical riddles, he ordered his Court with ſo much State, and ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Officers, that if he had been a King born, he could have done it no better. So much all his adverſaries acknowledge.</p>
               <p>In that Royal array he ſhewed himſelf three times a week in publick, and went up to a high Throne ſet up with great magnificence: Under him ſate <hi>Knipperdolling</hi> Governour of the City; and lower, his four great Counſellors of State. In that Court he he judged of all controverſies, moſt of which were about divorces, for by his new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders any man that was weary of his wife might take another, &amp; as many more as he liſted; which could not but multiply ſuits, and give work to the new King, and his Counſellors, and Prophets.</p>
               <p>In that Court <hi>Knipperdolling</hi> would ever come out with ſome <hi>Bedlam</hi> rapture: Once he fell flat to the ground, and creeping upon his hands and feet, he went to ſeveral perſons of the Aſſembly, and blowing them in the mouth ſaid, The Father hath ſanctified thee, receive the holy Ghoſt; Another time he fell a dancing, ſaying, So I danc't once with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170433:23"/> my little harlot, and now the heavenly Father hath commanded me that I ſhould dance ſo in the Kings preſence: Another time before the King came, he ſate in his chair of Majeſty, and there prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied that he ſhould die and riſe again, and that then the eys of the blind ſhould be open; But the King comming, ſhewed him that the ſpirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets muſt be ſubject unto the Prophets, for he pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him down and committed him to the Jail for three days.</p>
               <p>This jolly Taylor having thus ſtitched up a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in haſte, turned his ſerious care to go thorow ſtitch with it: For that there was need of ſupply to to remove the Biſhop that hindered his work; And becauſe all ſhould be done in a Prophetical way, <hi>Tuiſcocurer,</hi> his chief agent, came to him (as it ſeems by his appointment) one day as he was ſitting in his Throne with more than ordinary Majeſty, and told him, King <hi>John,</hi> the Goſpel muſt be renewed by thee; Thus ſaith the Lord God, Go and ſay to the King of <hi>Sion,</hi> that he prepare my holy Supper in the Church-yard of the great Church, and that he chuſe Teachers of my word, to ſend into the four Cuar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the World, to teach all men the ways of righteouſneſs, and bring them by the ſpirit of their mouth into my Sheepfold: ſo a publick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was celebrated, but they made it a full meal; A great feaſt <hi>(r)</hi> it was, both for the perſons and the meat, for they were above four thouſand men, and had three courſes: But between theſe courſes, there was a ſoul entercourſe, for the King accuſed a man of Treaſon, and cut off his head with his own
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170433:24"/> hand, and returned merry to ſupper; Then with his bloody hand he took upon him to adminiſter the body and blood of Chriſt<note n="ſ" place="margin">

               <p>After ſupper, the King asked the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, whether they were all heartily diſpoſed to do Gods Will, and to ſuffer and die for the faith; to which the people anſwered with one voice that they were all in that mind, then <hi>Tuiſcocurer</hi> aroſe and ſaid, Thus ſaith the Lord, chuſe men among my people, to ſend into the 4 quarters of the world,<note n="u" place="margin">Where will they ſtop.</note> to do great wonders among the nations, &amp; publiſh my wonderous things among the ſtrange people; then he read a note of the names of thoſe whom God had choſen for that legation<note n="w" place="margin">Our Quakers have men every where.</note> of whom himſelf was one; they were 26.

With that noiſe having raiſed a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, they were apprehended &amp; brought to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, before whom they ſpread a cloak upon the ground, and threw their coin upon it; ſaying, that they were ſent by the Father to offer them peace, which if they refuſed, they would leave that coin amongſt them as a pledge of Gods wrath againſt their ungratefulneſs and hardneſs of heart. That the time was come, foretold by the prophets, that the whole world ſhould follow righteouſneſs which God would work by their King, and when he had made righteouſneſs to raign over all the world, that then he ſhould give up the Kingdom unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>The princes of the Empire, ſeeing their danger, if this pretended King of the world came out and met with his confederates, met at <hi>Goblents</hi> as they had appointed, and took a courſe for the Biſhops help, and the ſtraight beſieging of the Town; and ſent letters to the people of <hi>Munſter</hi> to repreſent them their fault and their danger; and that if they did not ſubmit to their natural Prince, they ſhould draw all the forces of the Empire upon them. This was about the end of <hi>December,</hi> 1534.</p>

               <p>To draw towards the laſt Acts of that wild King, among the Prophets that were taken, one called <hi>Henry Hilverſum</hi> was ſaved by the Biſhop, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome private conference with him, let him go;

               <p>For that expedition he had loaden <hi>Henry Hilver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum</hi> with ſo much Gold that he could ſcarce go, wherefore he went no further than the Biſhops camp, where he ſtayed. <hi>John Nortell</hi> went as far as <hi>Deventer,</hi> and ſoon after returned without effect. <hi>Hilverſum</hi> writ a ſenſible letter to the people of

               <p>Theſe letters moved the hearts of many that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready were weary of that life; for their publike or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary grew ſhort, and was reduced to one meal a day, and a ſhort one, where their community of goods was violated; for every one had his bread by weight: But while they faſted in the Town, they feaſted in the Court; for the King fared ſumptuouſly to the very laſt. Which one of his wives diſliking, ſaid once, that ſhe thought not that ſuch a courſe was pleaſant to God, that in the publike miſery, while ſome pined for hunger, others ſhould ſurfet with plenty. The King being told of it, brought her to the market place with his other wives, made her kneel down, and cut off her head, then made his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wives to ſing and give praiſes for it to their heavenly father. Then he led a dance<note n="h" place="margin">A mad dance from firſt to laſt.</note>, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the people to dance, and rejoice with him, though the poor people had no great heart to dance, being fed with bread and ſalt only.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time two young men of the Town, weary of that fare, were taken running away, and brought back unto the King, who killed them both with his own hand.

That God was powerful enough to ſend them Manna and Quails from heaven. That he had great troops in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Frize</hi> that would certainly come with great proviſion of victual, and beat the enemie back. That God had revealed unto him, that at Eaſter they ſhould be delivered for certain.</p>
               <p>To confirm the people, he would from that time appear every day abroad in his greateſt glory, and made his Queen ſhew her ſelf often with a crown of gold on her head, and royally attired and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhe became that pomp very well for ſhe was of an exquiſite beauty; Himſelf altered one point of his ordinary pomp; for whereas the Bible was carried before him at his right hand, and a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſword on the left, be transferred the Sword<note n="l" place="margin">The ſword is the ſtrongeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to the right hand, of which he gave this reaſon, that the Goſpel had been preſented to the impenitent world, but now the Sword came in the place, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe that had rejected the Goſpel. With ſuch toys and riddles he fed the eyes and the ears of the hungry people, much like the <hi>Lydians</hi> that invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed games to paſs away their hunger in a year of famine.</p>

But he was killed in a tumult which he had raiſed in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and ſame troops of his confederates that were coming to relieve <hi>Munſter,</hi> were defeated in <hi>Frize</hi> at <hi>Balſwerd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This poor Lord of miſrule, hearing thoſe ill news caſt off all hope, and could no more put a good face to his deſperate caſe; For famine was fierce in the town, bread was ſpent long ago; horſes, dogs, and cats were conſumed, the graſs and the very roots were pickt out of the ground: and the people ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited from the camp, but more by their own extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, were taking counſel to take the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him to the enemie, to buy their peace. In that extremity the King commands the gates to be ſet open, and that as many as would ſhould go forth: So in one day a thouſand of all ages and ſexes went out of the Town, and yeilded to the mercy of the Prince, who mildly received them<note n="o" place="margin">Mercie to many, juſtice on few, is both good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie and chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note>, fed them, and let them go.</p>
               <p>A few days after, famine increaſing in the Town,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170433:28"/> the King proclaimed that as many as wanted faith in Gods help, ſhould void the Town, ſaying withall, that thoſe that ſhould forſake the faith, ſhould be forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God<note n="p" place="margin">True, but not of his Faith.</note>. Many were ſo blindly zealous, that this ſpeech ſtaid them, &amp; they choſe rather to periſh in the Town, than ſeem to forſake the faith; yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weary to feed upon ſtarved mice, and broiled ſhoes, and lean Propheſies, harkened to good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and took the ſafety that was offered them. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius Corvinus</hi> a Lutheran Divine writes, that he hath ſeen books whoſe covering was eaten in the famine, and that when the town was taken, children half eaten were found in corners. Yet in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral famine, the King had ſix months proviſion left, and kept a good table to the very laſt.</p>

The noiſe of it awaked the Townſmen, who by reaſon of their light ſupper, had but a light ſleep. They had time to make a ſtrong barrecado in the market place, and fought valiantly a long time, putting the Biſhops Souldiers to the worſe till they broke open one of the Town gates and let in more men.

                  <hi>March,</hi> letters came from the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, who was Lord of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> offering a free pardon to all of that ſect, that would within a fortnight repent and confeſs their error, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall that all perſons perſiſting in that ſect ſhould be ſeverely puniſht according to the Laws. Yet the ſame month, a great multitude of <hi>Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts</hi> with their wives and children, leaving all their eſtates, but what they could carry in mony, offered to go over to <hi>Overyſſel</hi> with twelve ſhips, and being asked whither they went, they ſaid they went to ſeek ſuch land as God would give them; But they were ſtayed, the Secretary of the <hi>Hague</hi> being ſent in time to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> by the Emperor to diſpatch a convenient number of ſhips to fight with them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they disbanded &amp; returned home; it is like they were going to <hi>Munſter,</hi> the Sion of the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reſtraint made them more fierce, like a ſtream that ſwels when it is ſtopt: for the next day at noon five <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> came naked through the ſtreets with their ſwords in their hands, crying, <hi>In the name of the Lord, The bleſſing of God lyeth upon one part of the City, and his curſe on the other.</hi> They were ſoon followed with others in arms, and the Magiſtrate raiſed in all haſte ſome companies of Archers to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them: The authors of the ſedition were taken, and all was quiet for that time.</p>
               <p>The ſame day, ſuch another ſedition was raiſed at <hi>Harlem,</hi> in which ſix <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> were ſlain, and two at the <hi>Hague</hi> were executed for the like cauſe. Shortly after, ſix of the moſt ſeditions were burnt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170433:30"/> at <hi>Harlem,</hi> and two women drowned.</p>
               <p>In <hi>May</hi> following, letters from <hi>Frize</hi> were read in the Counſel of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> giving warning of a plot of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> both of <hi>Frize</hi> and other parts, to meet in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> upon a certain day, and make themſelves maſters of the Town. Preſently the Magiſtrates raiſed the Trained bands of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and made them ſtand in arms about the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe while they ſate in Counſel; then a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſent forth, that none in the City upon pain of death ſhould harbor any ſtranger <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> &amp; that all the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> that were in the City ſhould void it before 5 of the clock in the afternoon; That whoſoever ſhould ſtay after that time, ſhould be put to death, without any remiſſion. Towards night the Magiſtrates ſent to ſearch all the houſes and took twenty of them; Four days after the Count of <hi>Hoch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> Governor of <hi>Holland,</hi> came into the City with great part of the Counſel of <hi>Holland;</hi> &amp; then eleven of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> were beheaded, and four burnt alive; Thirty ſix of that ſect having abjured it, were condemned to walk in proceſſion barehead &amp; bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot with white ſheets about them, and burning torches in their hands; Before the month was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, more were found, and more executed, nine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and four burnt, nothing but fire and ſword could repreſs the ſeditiou fury of that fanatical ſect.</p>
               <p>About this time two Prophets of <hi>Munſter, James</hi> of <hi>Kemp,</hi> and <hi>John Nathias</hi> of <hi>Midleborough,</hi> were ſent by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> to raiſe there a party for him; <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Kemp,</hi> he had made Governor of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> where he had as much
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170433:31"/> right to command, as in <hi>Munſter.</hi> Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> raiſed new tumults, which cauſed the Earl of <hi>Hochſtrat,</hi> to return in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> to confirm the people in the Emperors obedience: In his way he viſited <hi>Leyden, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and <hi>Delfe,</hi> and having called the Burgeſſes of the Cities, he concluded the deſtruction of all the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> Being come to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> he ſent for the Magiſtrates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chid them grievouſly for being ſo remiſſe in Executions, and preſently committed two noted <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> Upon which a rumour being ſpread in the City, that the night after, two hundred ſhould be taken and ſent bound to the <hi>Hague,</hi> there to be executed, a great multitude aroſe towards night, and ſtood in armes about the town-houſe, the Magiſtrates raiſed the trained bands, and came reſolved to fall upon them, but bloudſhed was prevented by the wiſe and moderate counſell of two of the beſt, who undertook to ſend them home with good words, and ſo they did; for having asked them why they aſſembled themſelves in the night in ſuch a tumultuous manner, the <hi>Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts</hi> anſwered that they would not be taken ſleeping in their Beds; the Magiſtrates promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon their faith and credit, that they ſhould receive no harm, and ſo they were quieted and disbanded: But this uprore did ſo fright the Count of <hi>Hochſtrat,</hi> that he withdrew himſelf preſently.</p>
               <p>All theſe were but preludes to a greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, wrought chiefly by that pernicious inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170433:31"/> 
                  <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Kemp,</hi> who lay hid in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſix months, appearing only in the night to keep Conventicles ſeducing the people: Herein he was ſtrongly ſeconded by <hi>John Geles,</hi> ſent by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> to be a leader of the wandring bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to <hi>Munſter,</hi> as we ſaid before, and that expectation made <hi>Munſter</hi> hold out ſo long.</p>
               <p>But <hi>John Geles</hi> being come to <hi>Frize</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> found no wandring <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the deſart, as it was reported in <hi>Munſter,</hi> wherefore he went to the Cities, where he made a great party, and cauſed ſeveral inſurrections, and yet was not ſeen in any for a long time.</p>
               <p>In <hi>January</hi> 1535.<note place="margin">An. 1535.</note> it was diſcovered that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> had a plot to ſet <hi>Leyden</hi> on fire by night, and although timely notice was given, fire was ſet in ſeveral places of the Town the houſes were ſearched, and the heads of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy were taken togrther in one houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The next month the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> plaid a mad prank in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in a womans houſe, whoſe husband was gone to the Weſt-Indies; ſeven men and five women of that ſect had a meeting. One of them <hi>Theodoret</hi> a Taylor, who bore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a Prophet, fell flat to the ground, and prayed with ſuch vehemency, that he ſcared all the aſſiſtants out of their wits<note n="b" place="margin">Our Quakers theſe mens Apes.</note> Then riſing, as it were out of an extaſie, I have ſeen (ſaid he) God in his Majeſty, and have ſpoken with him. I was wrapt up to Heaven, then I deſcended into

Then the poor condemned man fell on his knees, craving pardon, and the Prophet pardoned him<note n="e" place="margin">Pope like.</note>, and announced him a full remiſſion of all his ſins. Again in the night they met in the ſame place, the Women having left their Husbands a bed.

They were kept a while in priſon, till the great conſpiracy, two months after, and then were executed: the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of the houſe where the Conventicle was kept, was hanged before her own doors.</p>
               <p>In <hi>March,</hi> a thouſand men of that Sect, came out of <hi>Hainault</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> and were repulſed in time before they gathered more ſtrength.</p>

               <p>The frequent ſeditions in all parts of <hi>Holland</hi> were hardly repreſt with frequent executions, for <hi>John Geles</hi> was raiſing ſeditions from City to City, to frame a party for his King.

               <p>And becauſe <hi>Geles</hi> was in great fear to be known by his right name (for the only changing of his name by the Lawes of the Countrey was puniſhable by death) he was perſwaded by his friends to go to the Court of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and there confeſſe his fault, and buy his pardon (which he might well, for he had brought a great ſum of money out of <hi>Munſter</hi>) and then return and converſe freely and openly, with his own name, and have more liberty and opportunity to bring his deſignes to action.</p>
               <p>He went then to the Court, where Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, was Governeſſe of the ſeventeen Provinces, and ſped ſo well, that not only he obtained his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but got a great truſt in the Court, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to deliver the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. To that effect he got a Commiſſion under the Great Seal, with a good ſum of money, to leavy Soldiers for that ſervice.</p>
               <p>Having thus cozened the Court, he returned to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to cozen the Magiſtrates, who ſeeing his Commiſſion, and the greatneſſe of the deſigne, would emulate the truſt repoſed upon him by their Superiors, and ſhewed him much favour; he took his lodging in the Spaniſh Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, conſorted with men of that Nation and

               <p>He made ſuch uſe of that liberty, that in a ſhort time, he had contrived a moſt politick enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, to make himſelf Maſter of the City. In a night meeting, he announced to his brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood the Oracle of <hi>Henry Hilverſum,</hi> that God had given to the King of <hi>Sion Amſterdam, Weſell,</hi> and <hi>Daventer,</hi> for the firſt-fruits of his raign over the world, perſwading them that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was an eaſie matter, having but to do with a few idle Bellies, and that they had a fair opportunity at hand, to kill them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Town-houſe the twelfth of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>May,</hi> a day kept feſtival by antient cuſtom, by the ſociety of the Croſſe, who uſed to make a great Feaſt at night in the Town-houſe, and invite all the Magiſtrates, and men of means of the City, and there to ſpend moſt part of the night in drinking, and looking upon fire-works: That day then was deſigned for the enterprize, and their enemies noted and deſigned for the ſlaughter, and the richeſt houſes already ſhared amongſt them: they appointed for the ſignal of their riſing, the ringing of the Bell in the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe: Before they parted, <hi>John Geles</hi> gave to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one a Ducat for a bond of ſociety and ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. He and <hi>Henry Goethelit</hi> were to be the leaders.</p>
               <p>The appointed night being come, ſome <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts</hi> were up before the ſignal, which the reſt looking for, ſtayed ſo long, that the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize

Yet the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates were ſo long conſulting, that they were almoſt ſurprized by their enemies, who ruſhed with Colours flying, and Drums beating, into the Town-houſe, and killed ſome of the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and Waiters, and made the Maſters that went before, to go out of their Aldermans pace to ſave their lives. Then coming to the great place where the Bonfires were burning, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew them, that they might give more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and ſhoot undiſcerned upon the multitude; they killed many in the dark with Bullets, which they had poiſoned for fear of failing, and the Burgmaſter <hi>Peter Colin</hi> being come to encounter them with a Troop of Citizens, was by them ſlain, and his men put to flight, then one <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> a man of great authority in the City, and one that had valour and skill in War, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the ſtreets ſhould be ſtopt with great ſacks of Hops heaped up to be inſtead of Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, againſt the ſhot of the <hi>Anabaptiſts:</hi> And becauſe he truſted not in the fearful and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Citizens, he called Volunteers, to whom he promiſed a months pay for that dayes ſervice; by that means he got many that had
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170433:35"/> ſeen War before, and made a gallant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>The night being dark, he could attempt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing till day, onely he took an order that all the wayes to the market place (where the <hi>Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts</hi> ſtood in armes) ſhould be ſtopt, and that the reſt of the people ſhould keep at home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noiſe: this order frighted the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſeeing no hope to be aſſiſted by their brethren, who for want of the ſignal of the Bell were not come, and now it was too late for them to come, the waies being ſtopt, and having loſt the firſt opportunity of the fright of the people, who now were come to themſelves, and ſtood upon their defence. Then <hi>Goetbelit</hi> ſaid to <hi>Geles,</hi> this was my fear, that beginning this enterprize with ſo few, we ſhould come ſhort of it (for they were not above forty) now all that we have to do is to dye <hi>like men</hi>

                  <hi>Pſalms</hi> all night, at the break of day, the people perceiving them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhoot at them, which made them retire into the Town-houſe, and there keep ſtrong; the people brought Ordinance before it, and were ready to have battered it down, but <hi>Goſwin</hi> would try firſt to aſſault the door, which was done with effect, although the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> fought it out ſtoutly, and but twelve of them were taken, the reſt were killed, &amp; <hi>Goethelit</hi> one of them. <hi>John Geles</hi> that would by any means
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170433:35"/> cozen the hangman of his fees, got upon a little Steeple where the Town Bell hung, and gave a fair matk to the Soldiers below, who ſhot him thorow, whereof he fell down dead into the place. The priſoners were executed and ſome more of the town, and ſome living with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gates, who hearing ſhooting of guns, were come to pillage the City, ſuppoſing that it was taken.

For it had been proclaimed in the Town, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould harbour him, and not diſcover him before night, ſhould be hanged at his door, but he that ſhould diſcover him, ſhould have a great reward. He was found hid in a heap of turves, and executed with ignominy, having a two hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Miter on his head, becauſe he played the Biſhop. His tongue was cut off, wherewith he had preached Sedition, and his hand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now the heart of that Faction was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in all the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> for they left not ſearching and executing in every City, till all that Generation was exſtinct or brought ſo low, that they left plotting. Ten years after, ſome reliques of that Faction would offer to ſtir at <hi>Leyden,</hi> the Authors being taken and examined, confeſt that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> had choſen a King, who was not crowned yet, and was to ſucceed <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and another to be his high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer and that both were at <hi>Utrecht.</hi> Both were apprehended, and kept ſome months in priſon. Among other exploits of that elected King, he had brought his Wife into a Wood, and there killed her, that without interruption he might lye with her daughter, and had lately cut a young wenches throat leaſt ſhe ſhould detect him; good ſtore of Plate was found in his houſe, moſt of it Church Plate: It ſeems that party began to make a ſtock for a new Kingdome, the King and his Treaſurer were burnt.

                  <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who did their beſt to reduce them with reaſon and mildneſſe: for eight or nine weeks together, they conferred with them every Tueſday, and being overcome in diſpute, they fled to Revelations, their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſanctuary, falling into a Trance bafore the company, and when they waked out of it, ſaying that they had a Revelation that the doctrine of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was damnable, and <hi>Anabaptiſme</hi> holy, and that the day of Judgement ſhould be within two years. Daily they prophecyed in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, girded about <hi>with a rope</hi>

                  <hi>Zurick</hi> as <hi>Ionas</hi> did to <hi>Nineve,</hi> after which it muſt bdeſtroyed. After a long patience of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate they were put in Priſon, where they were again convented in conference by the Miniſters, and many times conducted by their Keepers to a publick meeting, where all the people might hear the conference. Finding themſelves ſhort of reaſon, and confuted by Scripture, they would anſwer, that what they could not prove by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Scripture, they would prove by their bloud. Thus ten conferences were held, and two of them in the Church, every conference laſting three dayes, where they got ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit to their cauſe, that the number of their Sectaries decreaſed much, and the Senate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that if any ſhould re-baptize ſuch as were baptized already, he ſhould be drowned. And ſo many were baptized the third time, and <hi>Zurick</hi> was in peace.</p>
               <p>The Genius of that Sect was every where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, for they went from City to City where they heard that reformation was received, (not to any Popiſh town) and whereſoever they came, they preſently troubled the State, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all with clamour and ſedition. By them was the town of <hi>Walzut</hi> miſerably ranſacked, and all the Inhabitants driven away out of their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The like they were like to have done at <hi>Worms,</hi> at <hi>Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It were an endleſſe task to rehearſe their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral errors, which becauſe all among them were Preachers, could not but multiply <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> They held among other things, that rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized men cannot ſin, becauſe they are Gods children; that all Miniſters that hold Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livings, are from the Devil: that the Apoſtles had nothing proper, but went from houſe to houſe; ſome would ſay that they had no need of the Lords Prayer, becauſe they prayed by the Spirit; many denyed the God-head of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One of them committed a notable impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, In the night time he put a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Fiſhes in a foul puddle, where the people uſed to waſh Horſes, and in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he Propheſied, thus ſaith the Lord, caſt Nets in this Puddle, and you ſhall get good Fiſh, a thing incredible, for never any Fiſh was ſeen there. But at his word, his Diſciples
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170433:38"/> caſt the Net, and encloſed multitude of Fiſhes, ſo that the Net brake. Thus the profane Raskall would imitate the miracle of Chriſt, and God in his anger gave efficacy of error to that falſe miracle which deceived many.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Baſel</hi> there was an uproar of ſome Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages who would have three things, aboliſh all Tithes, pull down all Magiſtrates, and kill all the ungodly, but they were ſtopt in time, and disbanded and fined. The ground of theſe attempts of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, was a <note n="f" place="margin">That Dream is not yet fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep.</note> 
                  <hi>dream</hi> they had of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdome of Chriſt, with whom all the godly ſhould raign in Earth without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of Body or Soul, all Gods enemies being deſtroyed firſt, for all <hi>Ambaptiſts</hi> were and are ſtill <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> expounding litterally that Kingdome of a thouſand years, of <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.6. to be a temporal Kingdome. That fancy put many of them out of their wits, all the Hiſtories that ſpeake of them, relate many examples of their looking ſeriouſly for the coming of the Lord upon ſuch a night, being warned by Revelation, which made them faſt and pray that night, and put all their buſineſſes out of order.</p>
               <p>Much conference they had with the Angell <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and one of their women, a very poor one, ſaw him to her thinking, in a viſion, bidding her to lay the cloth, and invite her neighbour, and that God would ſend her Manna and Quails

               <p>Under pretence of childiſh innocency, they played many mad pranks, one having kept his excrements in ſtore many days, powred it into the ſtreet, and turned himſelf naked into it, ſaying for his reaſon, that unleſſe we be made like li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Mad feats might have been ſuffered or repreſt with mild courſes, but their general deſign to pull down all Magiſtrates, and kill all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, that is, all that were none of their ſect, provoked the juſt ſeverity of the princes and Commonwealths againſt them; and for 20. years, many thouſands of them were killed, burned and drowned, till their reliques were ſo contemtible, that they were let alone for compaſſion.</p>

What hath bin done in the ſettlement of our civill Rights, Peace, and wholſom Laws, we bleſſe God for, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> as his inſtruments; Nor can we but acknowledge what hath been done by them in the Cauſe of God, as their Acts againſt <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Fornication, Swearing, Drunkenneſs, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both-breaking:</hi> Ordinances againſt promoters of Heretical Doctrines.

A diſcovery of the grounds of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment in</hi> Northampton <hi>cum</hi> aliis.
