         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But (as you are the Defender of the Faith,) you have Å¿ome obligation upon you to patro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niÅ¿e it; For when had the Faith of ChriÅ¿t more need of Defence then now? and when was it more aÅ¿Å¿aulted, and adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by BlaÅ¿phemous tenets, and Heretie

            <p>REader, thou haÅ¿t here an exact account and HiÅ¿tory of the Opinions, BlaÅ¿phemies, and practiÅ¿es of the <hi>Old Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiÅ¿ts</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> which Å¿o much infeÅ¿ted thoÅ¿e States; and the <hi>New Quakers</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which have (of late) Å¿o much moleÅ¿ted us: I have taken the pains of the Collection, that we being fore-warned of them, may be fore-armed againÅ¿t them, to avoid the like danger: they are a generation moÅ¿t peÅ¿tiferous in their Doctrine, and dangerous in their Seduction, and Å¿o ought of all men to be avoided. There are many of late, and Å¿ome of noble rank and quality, that are Å¿enÅ¿ible of their erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways, and are reduced from them; it is hoped (in a little time) many more will be Å¿o wiÅ¿e to do the like, which may prove the Death and Burial of their fanatick doctrine.</p>
            <p>I have made a faithful Collection both out of their own books, and out of Authors of known reputation, and (that I may the better cleer my integrity therein, I have all the way along) noted the Book, and the Page where every particular is mentioned.

               <p>It is hard to Å¿ay whether <hi>CaroloÅ¿tadius</hi> or one <hi>Nicholas Stock,</hi> was the firÅ¿t founder of <hi>Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiÅ¿m.

He taught that the Saints muÅ¿t reign in the World, and that he muÅ¿t be their leader, to kill all the Kings and Princes of the World, and repurge the Church: He took upon him to have the gift of diÅ¿cerning the Spirits, and know the Elect; he made holineÅ¿s to conÅ¿iÅ¿t in Å¿peaking little, and living homely and<note n="(d)" place="margin">Our Quakers Å¿ordid enough, but great talkers.</note> Å¿ordidly.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170433:15"/> very few that could read or write. When they were confuted by reaÅ¿ons or teÅ¿timonies of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, their anÅ¿wer was, that the Spirit taught them otherwiÅ¿e, and that the Spirit bloweth where he liÅ¿teth, and doth not inÅ¿pire every one.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e fancies were increaÅ¿ed by one <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> with many groÅ¿s and monÅ¿trous Additions: The Å¿ect by his Å¿eduction in Å¿hort time grew Å¿o Å¿trong, as to deÅ¿piÅ¿e all Rule, all Judges, and all Courts, and chuÅ¿e private Rulers among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, who determined of all cauÅ¿es, and Å¿ate upon life and death.</p>
               <p>But their rage could not keep long at home; They would Å¿ometimes ruÅ¿h out of Cities in great troops, and ranÅ¿ack Convents and Rich mens houÅ¿es, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for their warrant the example of the IÅ¿raelites, that took the Å¿poyl of the Egyptians: Yet in theÅ¿e incurÅ¿ions they made ConÅ¿cience at the firÅ¿t to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any Temple of thoÅ¿e that were not re-baptized, but made no conÅ¿cience to lye with their wives as left for a prey to the godly.</p>
               <p>This was their preparation for the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about which they had many revelations: One of their Prophets proclaimed that within three days the laÅ¿t judgment Å¿hould come<note n="(c)" place="margin">dooms<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day <hi>Sedgw.</hi>

               <p>This oracle was followed with great Å¿houtings and acclamations of the people, crying, <hi>God Å¿ave the King,</hi> and preÅ¿ently he was brought to S. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> Church-yard, and there again proclaimed K.</p>
               <p>There the new King created four CounÅ¿ellors of State, the chief whereof was one <hi>Gerard</hi> a Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binder, one <hi>Talbeck</hi> he made Lord Steward of his houÅ¿hold, <hi>Gerard Kippenbrok</hi> TreaÅ¿urer of his Plate and Jewels, <hi>Knipperdolling</hi> Governor of the City, and appointed twelve Archers of his Guard.</p>
               <p>This Taylor King preÅ¿ently made uÅ¿e of his skill to make himÅ¿elf fine in clothes. He tranÅ¿lated the copes and carpets of the Churches &amp; convents, into dublets and breeches, and cloaks, which Å¿et off his MajeÅ¿ty all in gold and Å¿ilver. His horÅ¿es wore a Å¿uitable livery, richly harneÅ¿Å¿ed with golden and Å¿ilver Saddles and footcloths; he had great change of rich apparel, in which he appeared abroad, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his chief Officers aid CounÅ¿ellors riding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in great State. Next to him rid two young men richly attired, the one carrying a naked Å¿word with a golden hilt, Å¿et with precious Å¿tones, the other carried a Bible and a <hi>triple Crown</hi> of gold, of exquiÅ¿ite work, glittering with diamonds. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf wore a great <hi>chain of gold about his neck,</hi> like a Coller of Å¿ome noble Order, with a golden Globe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170433:23"/> having a golden Sword thorough it, hanging at the chain, with this Motto about the Globe, <hi>Rex juÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae hujus mundi,</hi> the King of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of this world. After him followed fifty PenÅ¿ioners clad with parti-coloured garments of aÅ¿h-colour and graÅ¿s-green, white caps, and golden rings on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very finger, making the aÅ¿h-colour an emblem of mortification, the graÅ¿s-green of regeneration, the white caps of innocencie, the golden rings of charity: but among theÅ¿e prophetical riddles, he ordered his Court with Å¿o much State, and Å¿o diÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed his Officers, that if he had been a King born, he could have done it no better. So much all his adverÅ¿aries acknowledge.</p>
               <p>In that Royal array he Å¿hewed himÅ¿elf three times a week in publick, and went up to a high Throne Å¿et up with great magnificence: Under him Å¿ate <hi>Knipperdolling</hi> Governour of the City; and lower, his four great CounÅ¿ellors of State. In that Court he he judged of all controverÅ¿ies, moÅ¿t of which were about divorces, for by his new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders any man that was weary of his wife might take another, &amp; as many more as he liÅ¿ted; which could not but multiply Å¿uits, and give work to the new King, and his CounÅ¿ellors, and Prophets.</p>
               <p>In that Court <hi>Knipperdolling</hi> would ever come out with Å¿ome <hi>Bedlam</hi> rapture: Once he fell flat to the ground, and creeping upon his hands and feet, he went to Å¿everal perÅ¿ons of the AÅ¿Å¿embly, and blowing them in the mouth Å¿aid, The Father hath Å¿anctified thee, receive the holy GhoÅ¿t; Another time he fell a dancing, Å¿aying, So I danc't once with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170433:23"/> my little harlot, and now the heavenly Father hath commanded me that I Å¿hould dance Å¿o in the Kings preÅ¿ence: Another time before the King came, he Å¿ate in his chair of MajeÅ¿ty, and there prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ied that he Å¿hould die and riÅ¿e again, and that then the eys of the blind Å¿hould be open; But the King comming, Å¿hewed him that the Å¿pirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets muÅ¿t be Å¿ubject unto the Prophets, for he pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him down and committed him to the Jail for three days.</p>

               <p>For that expedition he had loaden <hi>Henry Hilver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿um</hi> with Å¿o much Gold that he could Å¿carce go, wherefore he went no further than the BiÅ¿hops camp, where he Å¿tayed. <hi>John Nortell</hi> went as far as <hi>Deventer,</hi> and Å¿oon after returned without effect. <hi>HilverÅ¿um</hi> writ a Å¿enÅ¿ible letter to the people of

                  <hi>MunÅ¿ter,</hi> wherein he acknowledged that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer PropheÅ¿ies were impoÅ¿tures, and exhorted them to open their eys to Å¿ee how they were delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a company of RaÅ¿cals; what beaÅ¿tly life they led, having violated all Laws of pudicity and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ty, and what danger they were in, of a miÅ¿erable deÅ¿truction.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e letters moved the hearts of many that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready were weary of that life; for their publike or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary grew Å¿hort, and was reduced to one meal a day, and a Å¿hort one, where their community of goods was violated; for every one had his bread by weight: But while they faÅ¿ted in the Town, they feaÅ¿ted in the Court; for the King fared Å¿umptuouÅ¿ly to the very laÅ¿t. Which one of his wives diÅ¿liking, Å¿aid once, that Å¿he thought not that Å¿uch a courÅ¿e was pleaÅ¿ant to God, that in the publike miÅ¿ery, while Å¿ome pined for hunger, others Å¿hould Å¿urfet with plenty. The King being told of it, brought her to the market place with his other wives, made her kneel down, and cut off her head, then made his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wives to Å¿ing and give praiÅ¿es for it to their heavenly father. Then he led a dance<note n="h" place="margin">A mad dance from firÅ¿t to laÅ¿t.</note>, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the people to dance, and rejoice with him, though the poor people had no great heart to dance, being fed with bread and Å¿alt only.</p>
               <p>At the Å¿ame time two young men of the Town, weary of that fare, were taken running away, and brought back unto the King, who killed them both with his own hand.

That God had revealed unto him, that at EaÅ¿ter they Å¿hould be delivered for certain.</p>
               <p>To confirm the people, he would from that time appear every day abroad in his greateÅ¿t glory, and made his Queen Å¿hew her Å¿elf often with a crown of gold on her head, and royally attired and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Å¿he became that pomp very well for Å¿he was of an exquiÅ¿ite beauty; HimÅ¿elf altered one point of his ordinary pomp; for whereas the Bible was carried before him at his right hand, and a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Å¿word on the left, be transferred the Sword<note n="l" place="margin">The Å¿word is the Å¿trongeÅ¿t Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to the right hand, of which he gave this reaÅ¿on, that the GoÅ¿pel had been preÅ¿ented to the impenitent world, but now the Sword came in the place, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troy thoÅ¿e that had rejected the GoÅ¿pel. With Å¿uch toys and riddles he fed the eyes and the ears of the hungry people, much like the <hi>Lydians</hi> that invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed games to paÅ¿s away their hunger in a year of famine.</p>
               <p>Well, EaÅ¿ter came, and no help came; this put our Prophet King to his plunge; he Å¿hut himÅ¿elf up, fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Å¿ick, for Å¿ix days; then he came forth and Å¿aid to the people, that in his Å¿ickneÅ¿s God had

               <p>This poor Lord of miÅ¿rule, hearing thoÅ¿e ill news caÅ¿t off all hope, and could no more put a good face to his deÅ¿perate caÅ¿e; For famine was fierce in the town, bread was Å¿pent long ago; horÅ¿es, dogs, and cats were conÅ¿umed, the graÅ¿s and the very roots were pickt out of the ground: and the people Å¿oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited from the camp, but more by their own extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, were taking counÅ¿el to take the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him to the enemie, to buy their peace. In that extremity the King commands the gates to be Å¿et open, and that as many as would Å¿hould go forth: So in one day a thouÅ¿and of all ages and Å¿exes went out of the Town, and yeilded to the mercy of the Prince, who mildly received them<note n="o" place="margin">Mercie to many, juÅ¿tice on few, is both good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie and chriÅ¿t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note>, fed them, and let them go.</p>
               <p>A few days after, famine increaÅ¿ing in the Town,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170433:28"/> the King proclaimed that as many as wanted faith in Gods help, Å¿hould void the Town, Å¿aying withall, that thoÅ¿e that Å¿hould forÅ¿ake the faith, Å¿hould be forÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God<note n="p" place="margin">True, but not of his Faith.</note>. Many were Å¿o blindly zealous, that this Å¿peech Å¿taid them, &amp; they choÅ¿e rather to periÅ¿h in the Town, than Å¿eem to forÅ¿ake the faith; yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weary to feed upon Å¿tarved mice, and broiled Å¿hoes, and lean PropheÅ¿ies, harkened to good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿el, and took the Å¿afety that was offered them. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius Corvinus</hi> a Lutheran Divine writes, that he hath Å¿een books whoÅ¿e covering was eaten in the famine, and that when the town was taken, children half eaten were found in corners. Yet in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral famine, the King had Å¿ix months proviÅ¿ion left, and kept a good table to the very laÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>They had not held out Å¿o long, but that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces met at <hi>Coblents,</hi> could not agree about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, and Å¿o the Å¿iege went but Å¿lowly on; but the Emperour made them meet again at <hi>Wormes</hi> in Aprill, where fifty thouÅ¿and crowns a month were granted to the BiÅ¿hop for five months, and it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that after the taking of the Town, the innocent people Å¿hould be Å¿pared, and that all the good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens that were come out, or kept in by force, Å¿hould have reÅ¿tittuion of all their goods. By order of the Princes, the Army was delivered to <hi>OberÅ¿teyne,</hi> who becauÅ¿e the pay was Å¿low, which made the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<note n="q" place="margin">Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s in the Devils Service.</note> diÅ¿content and mutinous, could do no great exploit.</p>
               <p>Yet finally the town was taken in June 1535. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving endured a Å¿iege of eigtheen months.

The noiÅ¿e of it awaked the TownÅ¿men, who by reaÅ¿on of their light Å¿upper, had but a light Å¿leep. They had time to make a Å¿trong barrecado in the market place, and fought valiantly a long time, putting the BiÅ¿hops Souldiers to the worÅ¿e till they broke open one of the Town gates and let in more men.

               <p>The BiÅ¿hop entred into the City the next day with 1500 horÅ¿e, and brought out the Å¿poil of the town from the Å¿ouldiers; the citizens that had yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were Å¿pared; but the fierce <hi>AnabaptiÅ¿ts</hi> that could never be tamed, and lay hid in Å¿everal holes, were Å¿ought out and killed; Å¿ome Souldiers having made bold with the handÅ¿omeÅ¿t women, were poiÅ¿oned with them, and found dead in their beds. This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed the death of many women, revenge being as hot as luÅ¿t was before: the fairy Queen either eÅ¿ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped or was killed; for it was not known what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of her.</p>

They were condemned and executed as Traitors and Rebels, being tied to a Å¿take and pulled in divers parts of their bodies with hot pincers for an hour and more, and then Å¿tricken in the heart with a dagger; <hi>Krechting</hi> Å¿uffered the like death. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> Å¿hewed a great conÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if perÅ¿iÅ¿ting in evil may be called Å¿o; for being at the Å¿take, and hearing his Å¿entence read, he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that he had indeed offended the MagiÅ¿trate, but that he had not offended God<note n="x" place="margin">Pure! more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Body then Soul.</note>.

                  <hi>IÅ¿elÅ¿win,</hi> to meet him at <hi>AmÅ¿terdam,</hi> three or four dayes after the intended enterprize, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with that GarriÅ¿on to keep the Town; They came neer it, but hearing how matters went with their brethren, they diÅ¿perÅ¿ed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves preÅ¿ently, and returned home by Å¿everal wayes: He had appointed more<note n="q" place="margin">In wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneÅ¿Å¿e.</note> 
                  <hi>brethren</hi> from Å¿everal places, to come at a certain day; but they hearing the ill Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e of their tribe, took their way into <hi>England,</hi> in two Ships, and here it Å¿eemeth they have Å¿tayed ever Å¿ince.</p>
               <p>And now the heart of that Faction was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in all the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> for they left not Å¿earching and executing in every City, till all that Generation was exÅ¿tinct or brought Å¿o low, that they left plotting. Ten years after, Å¿ome reliques of that Faction would offer to Å¿tir at <hi>Leyden,</hi> the Authors being taken and examined, confeÅ¿t that the <hi>AnabaptiÅ¿ts</hi> had choÅ¿en a King, who was not crowned yet, and was to Å¿ucceed <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and another to be his high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urer and that both were at <hi>Utrecht.</hi> Both were apprehended, and kept Å¿ome months in priÅ¿on. Among other exploits of that elected King, he had brought his Wife into a Wood, and there killed her, that without interruption he might lye with her daughter, and had lately cut a young wenches throat leaÅ¿t Å¿he Å¿hould detect him; good Å¿tore of Plate was found in his houÅ¿e, moÅ¿t of it Church Plate: It Å¿eems that party began to make a Å¿tock for a new Kingdome, the King and his TreaÅ¿urer were burnt. That was the laÅ¿t Å¿park of that faction till our times.</p>

               <p>THE South of <hi>Germany,</hi> was not free from that Sect, at <hi>Zurick</hi> they began to pick a quarrel with<note n="a" place="margin">Their great quarrel it againÅ¿t them.</note> 
                  <hi>MiniÅ¿ters,</hi> who did their beÅ¿t to reduce them with reaÅ¿on and mildneÅ¿Å¿e: for eight or nine weeks together, they conferred with them every TueÅ¿day, and being overcome in diÅ¿pute, they fled to Revelations, their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Å¿anctuary, falling into a Trance bafore the company, and when they waked out of it, Å¿aying that they had a Revelation that the doctrine of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was damnable, and <hi>AnabaptiÅ¿me</hi> holy, and that the day of Judgement Å¿hould be within two years. Daily they prophecyed in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, girded about <hi>with a rope</hi>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170433:37"/> 
                  <hi>Zurick</hi> as <hi>Ionas</hi> did to <hi>Nineve,</hi> after which it muÅ¿t bdeÅ¿troyed. After a long patience of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trate they were put in PriÅ¿on, where they were again convented in conference by the MiniÅ¿ters, and many times conducted by their Keepers to a publick meeting, where all the people might hear the conference. Finding themÅ¿elves Å¿hort of reaÅ¿on, and confuted by Scripture, they would anÅ¿wer, that what they could not prove by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on and Scripture, they would prove by their bloud. Thus ten conferences were held, and two of them in the Church, every conference laÅ¿ting three dayes, where they got Å¿o much diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit to their cauÅ¿e, that the number of their Sectaries decreaÅ¿ed much, and the Senate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that if any Å¿hould re-baptize Å¿uch as were baptized already, he Å¿hould be drowned. And Å¿o many were baptized the third time, and <hi>Zurick</hi> was in peace.</p>
               <p>The Genius of that Sect was every where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, for they went from City to City where they heard that reformation was received, (not to any PopiÅ¿h town) and whereÅ¿oever they came, they preÅ¿ently troubled the State, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all with clamour and Å¿edition. By them was the town of <hi>Walzut</hi> miÅ¿erably ranÅ¿acked, and all the Inhabitants driven away out of their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The like they were like to have done at <hi>Worms,</hi> at <hi>Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It were an endleÅ¿Å¿e task to rehearÅ¿e their Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral errors, which becauÅ¿e all among them were Preachers, could not but multiply <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> They held among other things, that rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized men cannot Å¿in, becauÅ¿e they are Gods children; that all MiniÅ¿ters that hold Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livings, are from the Devil: that the ApoÅ¿tles had nothing proper, but went from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e; Å¿ome would Å¿ay that they had no need of the Lords Prayer, becauÅ¿e they prayed by the Spirit; many denyed the God-head of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One of them committed a notable impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture, In the night time he put a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of FiÅ¿hes in a foul puddle, where the people uÅ¿ed to waÅ¿h HorÅ¿es, and in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he PropheÅ¿ied, thus Å¿aith the Lord, caÅ¿t Nets in this Puddle, and you Å¿hall get good FiÅ¿h, a thing incredible, for never any FiÅ¿h was Å¿een there. But at his word, his DiÅ¿ciples
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170433:38"/> caÅ¿t the Net, and encloÅ¿ed multitude of FiÅ¿hes, Å¿o that the Net brake. Thus the profane Raskall would imitate the miracle of ChriÅ¿t, and God in his anger gave efficacy of error to that falÅ¿e miracle which deceived many.</p>
               <p>By <hi>BaÅ¿el</hi> there was an uproar of Å¿ome Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages who would have three things, aboliÅ¿h all Tithes, pull down all MagiÅ¿trates, and kill all the ungodly, but they were Å¿topt in time, and disbanded and fined. The ground of theÅ¿e attempts of the <hi>AnabaptiÅ¿ts</hi> in Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, was a <note n="f" place="margin">That Dream is not yet fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿leep.</note> 
                  <hi>dream</hi> they had of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdome of ChriÅ¿t, with whom all the godly Å¿hould raign in Earth without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of Body or Soul, all Gods enemies being deÅ¿troyed firÅ¿t, for all <hi>AmbaptiÅ¿ts</hi> were and are Å¿till <hi>ChiliaÅ¿ts,</hi> expounding litterally that Kingdome of a thouÅ¿and years, of <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.6. to be a temporal Kingdome. That fancy put many of them out of their wits, all the HiÅ¿tories that Å¿peake of them, relate many examples of their looking Å¿eriouÅ¿ly for the coming of the Lord upon Å¿uch a night, being warned by Revelation, which made them faÅ¿t and pray that night, and put all their buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es out of order.</p>
               <p>Much conference they had with the Angell <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and one of their women, a very poor one, Å¿aw him to her thinking, in a viÅ¿ion, bidding her to lay the cloth, and invite her neighbour, and that God would Å¿end her Manna and Quails

Another woman had a revelation that God would keep her alive without meat, and Å¿he faÅ¿ted to death.</p>
               <p>Under pretence of childiÅ¿h innocency, they played many mad pranks, one having kept his excrements in Å¿tore many days, powred it into the Å¿treet, and turned himÅ¿elf naked into it, Å¿aying for his reaÅ¿on, that unleÅ¿Å¿e we be made like li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Others for the Å¿ame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, would ride naked upon Å¿ticks and hobby horÅ¿es like children, in great companies, and women would run naked with them, and then in pure innocency they lay together, and Å¿o in the end it proved childrens play indeed.<note n="g" place="margin">As the Quakers in <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheÅ¿ter.</hi>

               <p>Mad feats might have been Å¿uffered or repreÅ¿t with mild courÅ¿es, but their general deÅ¿ign to pull down all MagiÅ¿trates, and kill all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, that is, all that were none of their Å¿ect, provoked the juÅ¿t Å¿everity of the princes and Commonwealths againÅ¿t them; and for 20. years, many thouÅ¿ands of them were killed, burned and drowned, till their reliques were Å¿o contemtible, that they were let alone for compaÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
